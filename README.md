# Voice-Controlled Home Automation

## Overview

This project enables voice-controlled home automation using an Arduino board. The system includes functionalities to control various electrical appliances such as a TV, fan, light, and air conditioner (AC) via voice commands. The project was implemented and deployed at an NGO, allowing users to remotely manage home devices through a mobile app.

## Features

- **Voice Control:**
  - Turn on and off the TV, fan, light, and AC using voice commands.

- **Appliance Control:**
  - Individual control for each appliance for a personalized and convenient experience.

- **Arduino Integration:**
  - The project utilizes an Arduino board to interface with electrical appliances.

## Setup

1. **Connectivity:**
   - Connect the Arduino board to the respective pins of the electrical appliances (TV, fan, light, AC).

2. **Arduino Code:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the board using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Mobile App:**
   - Deploy the mobile app on your device to send voice commands to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. **Mobile App:**
   - Open the mobile app and connect it to the Arduino board.

2. **Voice Commands:**
   - Use voice commands such as "*TV on," "*fan off," etc., to control the appliances.

3. **Feedback:**
   - The Arduino board provides feedback by turning the respective pins high or low based on the voice commands.
